## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) defines the overall technical direction of Video.js, representing the broader community of users and contributors.

### Role and Responsibilities

The TSC has final authority over the project, including:

- Technical direction
- Decide on items that lack consensus among Collaborators.
- Project governance (this repository)
- Maintaing Collaborators list

### Membership

- **Invitation:** Long-term contributors showing dedication may be invited by the TSC.
- **Termination:** Members may resign voluntarily, be removed by the TSC, or are considered resigned after one year of inactivity.
- **Employer Balance:** No more than half of the TSC may be affiliated with the same organization. If exceeded, members must be added or removed to restore balance.

#### Current TSC Members

- [Garrett Singer](https://github.com/gesinger)
- [Gary Katsevman](https://github.com/gkatsev)
- [Steve Heffernan](https://github.com/heff) (Mux)
- [Matt McClure](https://github.com/mmcc) (Mux)

#### TSC Members Emeritus

- [Ben Clifford](https://github.com/mister-ben) (Brightcove)
- [Pat O'Neill](https://github.com/misteroneill) (Brightcove)

### TSC Meetings

The TSC meets quarterly via video call. Agendas include contribution policies, membership changes, and technical decisions not resolved by Collaborators.

It's not intended for the TSC meetings to review each PR but rather review issues that consensus-seeking has not succeeded.

## Corporate Shepherd

The Corporate Shepherd is the organization making the most significant ongoing investment—financial, staffing, or infrastructure—in Video.js. Any change to the Corporate Shepherd must be approved by the TSC.

### Benefits

- Prominent acknowledgment on the Video.js website and in official project communications.
- Right to promote itself as the project's primary sponsor and contributor.

### Responsibilities

- Staff and coordinate day-to-day maintenance of Video.js.
- Build and maintain the Video.js marketing website.
- Provide logistical, administrative, and infrastructure support for releases and community events.

### History

- **Zencoder:** 2010–2012
- **Brightcove:** 2013–2025
- **Mux:** 2025–present

## Collaborators

Collaborators are individuals granted access to the Video.js GitHub organization repositories. They work closely with the Corporate Shepherd and the TSC to maintain and advance the project. Collaborator status is granted or revoked by the TSC. All TSC members are Collaborators by default.

### Privileges

- Approve pull requests
- Merge pull requests
- Push new tags/releases
- Add items to the TSC agenda

### Collaborator Meetings

Collaborators meet monthly via video call to discuss strategic direction, review progress, and build consensus on ongoing work.

### Types of Collaborator

#### Community Collaborators

Community Contributors nominated by existing Collaborators based on multiple significant contributions. Nominations are reviewed at the following TSC meeting, or on an ad-hoc basis.

#### Core Collaborators

Employees of the Corporate Shepherd whose job functions include Video.js collaboration. Status persists throughout their employment; upon departure, they transition to Community Collaborator status.

## Contributors

Contributors are individuals who submit substantial code patches or documentation improvements. The full list of Contributors is maintained automatically via GitHub in each repository. For guidelines on contributing, see the [Video.js Contributor Guide](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Consensus Seeking Process

The TSC follows a [consensus-seeking model]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making) for decision-making.
